check this resources pls



you will learn 

1-how to deal with json  with easy trick    
2-how to use if condation in real example
3-how to parse result and use it with logic  code
4-saving data        

lets start


this is free api for proxys its public any one can use it 

http://pubproxy.com/api/proxy?api=&type

we will use it to get proxys and fetch http and socks4 and socks5

our logic will be like this


you should now creat files to save proxys

creat file with name result and creat empty files with  



lets save result 


perfect its now saved


lets do advanced staff



--------------------------------------------------

main point of all this is 
----------------------------------------------------

do request
fetch data
use this data in logic

get request 


 	if condation        
		do some thing
	else if              
		do some thing

	else condation

		finally do this





your request  then use logic

IF STRINGKEY $"http" NotEqualTo   $"http"
CLOG YellowGreen "-----------------http--------------------"
ELSE IF STRINGKEY $"socks4" Exists   $"socks4"
CLOG Yellow "-----------------socks4--------------------"
ELSE
CLOG Green "-----------------socks5--------------------"
END


this staff is advanced than key check

may you think code is big but as i mentioned before


loli scripts its blocks of code 

and we deal with it like this 


lets run our config
